### Time & Date: 

9am to 6pm on Feb 25, 2019

### Venue: 
Casuarina Hall <a href = https://www.indiahabitat.org/>India Habitat Centre, New Delhi</a>

### Instructors: 

<a href= http://www.nipgr.res.in/research/dr_gyadav.php>Dr Gitanjali Yadav | University of Cambridge/NIPGR</a>

#### General Information
  <a href="http://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a>
  workshops are for any researcher who has data they want to analyze, 
  and no prior computational experience is required. 
  This hands-on workshop module is a slight modification of the Data Carpentry Course at CRUK, University of Cambridge, and we hope to teache basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data.
  We will cover Data organization in spreadsheets, and learn how to use the statistical program R.
  
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

<p id="who">
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers.
  <strong>
    You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.
  </strong>
</p>

<p id="requirements">
  <strong>Requirements:</strong> 
 Participants will bring their own laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) 
  that they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software packages installed (listed
  <a href="#setup">below</a>). This can also be done after the course to re-engage with the materials. 
Participants are also required to abide by Data Carpentry's
<a href="https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2012/12/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.

  requirements.
<p>
  Materials will be provided in advance of the workshop and
  large-print handouts are available if needed by notifying the
  organizers in advance.  If we can help making learning easier for
  you (e.g. sign-language interpreters, lactation facilities) please
  get in touch and we will attempt to provide them.

## Setup

  To participate in a Data Carpentry workshop, you will need access to the software described below.
  In addition, you will need an up-to-date web browser.

  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.

## R 
### <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R</a> is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>

### Windows 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0PjTAylwoU">Video Tutorial</a>
        Install R by downloading and running
        <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm">this .exe file</a>
        from <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>
        Also, please install the
        <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">RStudio IDE</a>.
        Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the 
        installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as 
        administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, 
        for example when installing R packages.  
  ## MacOS
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ly3kyxwEg">Video Tutorial</a>
  Install R by downloading and running <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg">this .pkg file</a>
        from <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>.
        Also, please install the
        <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">RStudio IDE</a>
  ## Linux
  You can download the binary files for your distribution from <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>. Or
        you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu
        run <code>sudo apt-get install r-base</code> and for Fedora run
        <code>sudo dnf install R</code>).  Also, please install the
        <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">RStudio IDE</a>.
