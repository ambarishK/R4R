## Exercise Solution for Lesson: "Formatting data tables in Spreadsheets"
 
 ## Exercise
- We’re going to take a messy version of the survey data and describe how we would clean it up.
	- Download the data by clicking <a href="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2252083">here</a> to get it from FigShare.
	- Open up the data in a spreadsheet program.</li>
	- You can see that there are two tabs. Two field assistants conducted the surveys, one in 2013 and one in 2014, and they both kept track of the data in their own way. Now you’re the person in charge of this project and you want to be able to 
start analyzing the data.</li>
	- With the person next to you, identify what is wrong with this spreadsheet. Also discuss the steps you would need to take to clean up the 2013 and 2014 tabs, and to put them all together in one spreadsheet.
	- Important:  Do not forget our first piece of advice: to create a new file (or tab) for the cleaned data, never modify your original (raw) data.
	- After you go through this exercise, we’ll discuss as a group what was wrong with this data and how you would fix it.</p>

## Solution
    
   - Take about 10 minutes to work on this exercise
   - All the mistakes in <a href="../02-common-mistakes">02-common-mistakes</a> are present in the messy dataset. 
   - Ask people what they saw as wrong with the data. As they bring up different points, you can refer to <a href="../02-common-mistakes">02-common-mistakes</a> or expand a bit on the point they brought up.
   - If you get a response where they’ve fixed the date, you can pause and go to the <a href="../03-dates-as-data">03-dates-as-data</a> lesson. Or you can say you’ll come back to dates at the end.
