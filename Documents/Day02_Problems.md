* Good data organization is the foundation of your research
project. Most researchers have data or do data entry in
spreadsheets. Spreadsheet programs are very useful graphical
interfaces for designing data tables and handling very basic data
quality control functions. 





## Key Points
- Never modify your raw data. Always make a copy before making any changes.
- Keep track of all of the steps you take to clean your data in a plain text file.
- Organize your data according to tidy data principles.
