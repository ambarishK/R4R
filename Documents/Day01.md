Registration for the Workshop will begin this evening. All delegates will get their Workshop Kits at the Launch event.

We hope that delegates will use this evening for ice breaking and meeting each other. The evening will begin with Tea and Refreshments and end with Dinner.

There will be talks by Workshop Coordinators and Instructors.

We will have Round Table Introductions for everyone to introduce themselves and their work. Please prepare a two minute introdctory speech about yourself, your background and your current work.
