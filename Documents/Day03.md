#### General Information
  <a href="http://datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a>
  workshops are for any researcher who has data they want to analyze, 
  and no prior computational experience is required. 
  This hands-on workshop module is a slight modification of the Data Carpentry Course at CRUK, University of Cambridge, and we hope to teache basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data.
  We will cover Data organization in spreadsheets, and learn how to use the statistical program R.
  
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

<p id="who">
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers.
  <strong>
    You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.
  </strong>
</p>

<p id="requirements">
  <strong>Requirements:</strong> 
 Participants will bring their own laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) 
  that they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software packages installed (listed
  <a href="#setup">below</a>). This can also be done after the course to re-engage with the materials. 
Participants are also required to abide by Data Carpentry's
<a href="https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2012/12/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.
