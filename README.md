# R4R
This Repository contains the complete course material for the First TIGR2ESS FP2/FP3 Workshop on R for Genomics and Data Mining.  
The workshop will have lectures, Hands-on modules and exercises for use of 'R' in biological data analysis and advanced crop genomics. We will also explore techniques for data mining and analysis of scientific literature. The workshop is expected to be very data intensive and delegates are required to fully attend all days.
